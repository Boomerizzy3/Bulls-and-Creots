          Bulls and Creots (also known as Bulls and Cows) is a code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the commercially marketed board game Mastermind and the hit word game Wordle.
          The game is played in turns by two opponents who aim to decipher the other's secret code by trial and error.
          Each guess should be a 4 digit number with NO repeating numbers. If your guess contains a correct number in the correct position this is a "Bull." If your guess contains the correct number in an incorrect position this is a "Creot."
          You win when your guess contains 4 Bulls. Try to win in the fewest number of guesses as possible! Have fun!
